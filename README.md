What is Recursion?
Recursion is a programming technique where a method or function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. It is commonly used to break complex problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems.

Components of a Recursive Method
Base Case: The condition that stops the recursion. It prevents infinite calls and ensures the method completes.

Recursive Case: The part where the method calls itself with modified arguments, gradually moving closer to the base case.

Advantages of Recursion
Simplifies code for problems with repetitive patterns or structures (e.g., tree traversal, factorial computation).

Reduces complexity by breaking problems into smaller subproblems.

Disadvantages of Recursion
May lead to stack overflow if the base case is not properly defined or recursion depth is too high.

Often less efficient than iterative solutions due to repeated function calls and memory usage.

Common Use Cases
Mathematical computations (factorials, Fibonacci sequence, etc.)

Data structure traversal (trees, graphs)

Solving puzzles (Tower of Hanoi)
Key Principles to Avoid Infinite Recursion
Ensure the base case is reachable and logically sound.

Modify arguments in recursive calls to progress toward the base case.

Use limits or counters to monitor recursion depth.

Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: Depends on the number of recursive calls.

Space Complexity: Depends on the recursion depth, as each call consumes stack memory.

Version Control
When working on recursive programming projects:

Initialize a Git repository to manage your code efficiently.

Commit changes regularly to track your progress and revert if needed.
